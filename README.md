# Daily-Threat-Briefing-Reports

This repository contains daily cyber threat intelligence briefing reports generated by a local AI automation process. The goal of this project is to provide timely and actionable intelligence on the latest cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities, and threat actors.

## About The Project

This repository is an automated collection of daily cyber threat intelligence reports. Each report is generated to provide a comprehensive overview of the current threat landscape, helping security professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts stay informed about emerging risks.

The information is aggregated from various open-source intelligence (OSINT) sources and is structured to be easily digestible and actionable.
---

## Report Structure

Each daily briefing report is a markdown file named in the format `TH-DD-Mon-YYYY.md`. The reports are organized into the following sections:

1.  **Executive Summary**: A high-level overview of the day's most critical threats.
2.  **Notable Events & Assessments**: Detailed analysis of significant cyber events, campaigns, and malware.
3.  **Vulnerability & Exploitation Watch**: A curated list of new and actively exploited vulnerabilities.
4.  **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**: Actionable IOCs such as file hashes, IP addresses, and domains.
5.  **Threat Actors & Campaigns**: Updates on the activities of various threat groups.
6.  **Sector & Geo Risk Signals**: Industry-specific and regional threat assessments.
7.  **Third-Party & Supply-Chain Notes**: Information on threats related to vendors and the software supply chain.
8.  **Detections & Response Playbook Updates**: Suggestions for new detection rules and response actions.
9.  **Metrics & Hygiene**: Insights into exposure deltas and patch coverage.
10. **Assumptions, Gaps, and Tasking**: A summary of intelligence gaps and tasking for security teams.
11. **Source Log**: A list of all sources used to compile the report.

## How to Use

-   **Stay Informed**: Read the daily reports to keep up-to-date with the latest threats. The "Executive Summary" and "Priority Actions" are a good place to start for a quick overview.
-   **Threat Hunting**: Use the "Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)" section to search for malicious activity in your environment.
-   **Vulnerability Management**: Refer to the "Vulnerability & Exploitation Watch" table to prioritize patching for critical vulnerabilities.
-   **Detection Engineering**: Implement the "Detections & Response Playbook Updates" to enhance your security monitoring capabilities.

## Notes (Scope, Method, and Expectations)

### Focus, brevity, and actionability

#### Reports are intentionally concise: prioritised by impact > likelihood > exploitability with clear severity tags.

- I try to de-duplicate across sources and collapse near-identical IOCs/campaigns to reduce noise.
- “Vulnerability & Exploitation Watch” favours actively exploited or high-likelihood items over long CVE lists.
- Where possible, I include why it matters and what to do next (hunt queries, patch guidance, detection hints).

#### Cadence & SLA (managing expectations)
- Target is daily output; occasional gaps may occur due to source quality/availability or maintenance.
- I’ll choose quality over strict cadence—better a tight, accurate brief than a noisy one.

#### Sources, automation & future enhancements
- 100% OSINT; aggregation via a local workflow (n8n).
- Every report includes a Source Log for transparency and independent verification.
- Method improvements planned: better normalisation, IOC enrichment (whois/VT context), and scoring to highlight what deserves attention.

#### Context & limitations (how to use this responsibly)
- These briefs are not a substitute for your org’s context. Map items to your stack (variants, versions, exposure, crown jewels and tech echo system).
- Treat IOCs as starting points—validate against your telemetry to avoid false positives.
- “Detections & Response Playbook Updates” are suggestions, not prescriptive rules; tune to your data model (e.g., Sigma/EDR dialect).
- Risk varies by sector/region; the Sector & Geo Risk Signals section flags where relevance may be higher/lower.

#### Quality controls
- I remove uncorroborated claims, label rumour/low confidence, and update/correct in subsequent briefs. 
- Duplicates and stale campaigns are suppressed unless there are new TTPs, infrastructure, or exploitation.

#### Privacy & ethics
- No ingestion of private datasets or customer data. Only public OSINT.
