## About The Project

This repository is an automated collection of daily cyber threat intelligence reports. Each report is generated to provide a comprehensive overview of the current threat landscape, helping security professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts stay informed about emerging risks.

The information is aggregated from various open-source intelligence (OSINT) sources and is structured to be easily digestible and actionable.

1.  **Executive Summary**: A high-level overview of the day's most critical threats.
2.  **Notable Events & Assessments**: Detailed analysis of significant cyber events, campaigns, and malware.
3.  **Vulnerability & Exploitation Watch**: A curated list of new and actively exploited vulnerabilities.
4.  **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**: Actionable IOCs such as file hashes, IP addresses, and domains.
5.  **Threat Actors & Campaigns**: Updates on the activities of various threat groups.
6.  **Sector & Geo Risk Signals**: Industry-specific and regional threat assessments.
7.  **Third-Party & Supply-Chain Notes**: Information on threats related to vendors and the software supply chain.
8.  **Detections & Response Playbook Updates**: Suggestions for new detection rules and response actions.
9.  **Metrics & Hygiene**: Insights into exposure deltas and patch coverage.
10. **Assumptions, Gaps, and Tasking**: A summary of intelligence gaps and tasking for security teams.
11. **Source Log**: A list of all sources used to compile the report.
