### 10. Assumptions, Gaps, and Tasking

- **Assumption:** We assume that Microsoft Entra ID tenants are automatically patched for CVE-2025-55241 in cloud-managed environments, but on-premises components (if any) or specific configurations may require manual intervention. Confidence: Medium.
- **Gap:** We lack specific Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) for the new CountLoader malware and the ComicForm/SectorJ149 Formbook campaign beyond general descriptions. This limits proactive blocking.
