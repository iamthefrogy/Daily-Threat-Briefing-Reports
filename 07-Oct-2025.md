### 2. Notable Events & Assessments

#### **Cl0p Ransomware Exploiting Oracle E-Business Suite Zero-Day in Widespread Extortion Campaign**
- **Facts:**
    *   The Cl0p ransomware group (aka Graceful Spider) is exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability, CVE-2025-61882 (CVSS 9.8), in Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) versions 12.2.3 through 12.2.14. 【[https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/oracle-ebs-under-fire-as-cl0p-exploits.html](https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/oracle-ebs-under-fire-as-cl0p-exploits.html) (2025-10-07 10:42:00 UTC+0530)】, 【[https://cyberscoop.com/oracle-zero-day-clop/](https://cyberscoop.com/oracle-zero-day-clop/) (2025-10-06 21:34:10 UTC)】
    *   Exploitation began as early as August 9, 2025, allowing the threat actor to exfiltrate large volumes of data from victim networks for at least eight weeks before sending extortion demands. 【[https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/oracle-ebs-under-fire-as-cl0p-exploits.html](https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/oracle-ebs-under-fire-as-cl0p-exploits.html) (2025-10-07 10:42:00 UTC+0530)】
    *   Oracle has released an out-of-band emergency patch to address the vulnerability. 【[https://securityaffairs.com/183029/security/oracle-patches-critical-e-business-suite-flaw-exploited-by-cl0p-hackers.html](https://securityaffairs.com/183029/security/oracle-patches-critical-e-business-suite-flaw-exploited-by-cl0p-hackers.html) (2025-10-06 13:39:50 UTC)】
    *   The U.S. FBI and CISA are urging organizations to patch immediately. CISA has added CVE-2025-61882 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. 【[https://therecord.media/fbi-uk-urge-orgs-to-patch-after-clop-campaign](https://therecord.media/fbi-uk-urge-orgs-to-patch-after-clop-campaign) (2025-10-06 18:56:32 GMT)】, 【[https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/10/06/cisa-adds-seven-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/10/06/cisa-adds-seven-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) (2025-10-06 12:00:00 UTC)】
    *   Technical analysis indicates the exploit is a complex chain of multiple smaller vulnerabilities, suggesting deep expertise in Oracle EBS on the part of the attackers. 【[https://labs.watchtowr.com/well-well-well-its-another-day-oracle-e-business-suite-pre-auth-rce-chain-cve-2025-61882well-well-well-its-another-day-oracle-e-business-suite-pre-auth-rce-chain-cve-2025-61882/](https://labs.watchtowr.com/well-well-well-its-another-day-oracle-e-business-suite-pre-auth-rce-chain-cve-2025-61882well-well-well-its-another-day-oracle-e-business-suite-pre-auth-rce-chain-cve-2025-61882/) (2025-10-07 05:00:16 UTC+0300)】
- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess with **high confidence** that this campaign represents a severe and immediate threat to any organization using Oracle E-Business Suite. The combination of a critical, remotely exploitable zero-day and a highly capable threat actor like Cl0p creates a high probability of successful compromise for unpatched systems.
    *   We assess with **medium confidence** that Cl0p's targeting is opportunistic, focusing on any vulnerable internet-facing EBS instance they can find, rather than a specific sector. Their primary motive is financial gain through data extortion.
- **Relevance:**
    *   This is highly relevant to organizations that use Oracle E-Business Suite for critical business functions like finance, HR, and supply chain management.
    *   Exposure is primarily through internet-facing EBS instances. A successful exploit could lead to catastrophic data loss, business disruption, and significant financial impact from extortion demands.
- **ATT&CK:**
    *   T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application
    *   T1566: Phishing (Initial contact for extortion)
    *   T1071: Application Layer Protocol
    *   T1530: Data from Cloud Storage Object
    *   T1486: Data Encrypted for Impact (Though Cl0p's recent TTPs favor data theft and extortion over encryption)
- **Detection ideas:**
    *   Monitor web server and application logs for Oracle EBS for unusual requests, especially those matching patterns described in the watchTowr Labs technical deep-dive.
    *   Hunt for network connections originating from EBS servers to unfamiliar external IP addresses, which could indicate data exfiltration.
    *   The Oracle advisory includes Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) which should be ingested into SIEM and other security tools for immediate detection.
- **Mitigations:**
    *   Apply the emergency patch for CVE-2025-61882 immediately, as per Oracle's security alert. 【[https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2025-61882.html](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2025-61882.html)】
    *   If patching is not immediately possible, restrict access to EBS instances from the internet or implement strict firewall rules until the patch can be applied.

#### **Storm-1175 Exploiting Critical GoAnywhere MFT Flaw to Deploy Medusa Ransomware**
- **Facts:**
    *   Microsoft has observed the cybercrime group Storm-1175 actively exploiting CVE-2025-10035, a critical (CVSS 10.0) deserialization vulnerability in Fortra's GoAnywhere MFT. 【[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/10/06/investigating-active-exploitation-of-cve-2025-10035-goanywhere-managed-file-transfer-vulnerability/](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/10/06/investigating-active-exploitation-of-cve-2025-10035-goanywhere-managed-file-transfer-vulnerability/) (2025-10-07 05:00:15 UTC+0300)】
    *   The group is known for exploiting public-facing applications for initial access and is using this vulnerability to deploy Medusa ransomware. 【[https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-critical-goanywhere-bug-exploited-in-ransomware-attacks/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-critical-goanywhere-bug-exploited-in-ransomware-attacks/) (2025-10-06 14:11:46 UTC-0400)】
    *   The vulnerability allows an attacker with a forged license response signature to achieve remote code execution (RCE). The security advisory was first published by Fortra on September 18, 2025. 【[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/10/06/investigating-active-exploitation-of-cve-2025-10035-goanywhere-managed-file-transfer-vulnerability/](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/10/06/investigating-active-exploitation-of-cve-2025-10035-goanywhere-managed-file-transfer-vulnerability/) (2025-10-07 05:00:15 UTC+0300)】
- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess with **high confidence** that this presents a critical risk to organizations using vulnerable versions of GoAnywhere MFT. The active exploitation by a known ransomware actor means compromise is highly likely for unpatched systems.
    *   This campaign follows a well-established pattern of threat actors targeting managed file transfer (MFT) solutions, which are high-value targets due to the sensitive data they process.
- **Relevance:**
    *   Any organization using GoAnywhere MFT for file transfers is directly at risk. A successful attack will likely result in data encryption, data theft, and a significant ransomware demand, causing major business disruption.
- **ATT&CK:**
    *   T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application
    *   T1210: Exploitation of Remote Services
    *   T1486: Data Encrypted for Impact
    *   T1657: Financial Cryptojacking (If ransomware deployed)
- **Detection ideas:**
    *   Monitor GoAnywhere MFT logs for anomalous activity related to the License Servlet.
    *   Implement detection rules for Medusa ransomware TTPs, such as the creation of specific service names or the use of `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet`.
    *   Hunt for suspicious child processes spawning from the GoAnywhere MFT service process.
- **Mitigations:**
    *   Update GoAnywhere MFT to a patched version immediately, as recommended by Fortra's advisory from September 18, 2025.
    *   Ensure the application is not unnecessarily exposed to the internet.
    *   Review access logs for signs of compromise dating back to mid-September 2025.

#### **Red Hat Data Breach Escalates with Involvement of ShinyHunters Extortion Group**
- **Facts:**
    *   A hacking group named Crimson Collective breached a Red Hat GitLab instance used for consulting engagements, stealing approximately 570GB of compressed data. 【[https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/red-hat-data-breach-escalates-as-shinyhunters-joins-extortion/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/red-hat-data-breach-escalates-as-shinyhunters-joins-extortion/) (2025-10-07 05:00:13 UTC+0300)】
    *   The stolen data includes around 800 Customer Engagement Reports (CERs), which can contain sensitive details about customer networks, infrastructure, and platforms.
    *   Crimson Collective has now partnered with the notorious Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters / ShinyHunters group to continue extortion attempts against Red Hat using the ShinyHunters data leak site. 【[https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/red-hat-data-breach-escalates-as-shinyhunters-joins-extortion/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/red-hat-data-breach-escalates-as-shinyhunters-joins-extortion/) (2025-10-07 05:00:13 UTC+0300)】, 【[https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/red-hat-jack-customer-data-crimson-collective/802121/](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/red-hat-jack-customer-data-crimson-collective/802121/) (2025-10-06 10:59:02 UTC-0400)】
- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess with **high confidence** that this breach poses a significant third-party risk to Red Hat consulting customers whose information was in the stolen CERs. The involvement of ShinyHunters, a group known for large-scale data leaks, increases the likelihood that the stolen data will be publicly exposed or sold.
    *   The exposed infrastructure details could be used by other threat actors to craft highly targeted follow-on attacks against the affected Red Hat customers.
- **Relevance:**
    *   This is a direct supply-chain risk for any organization that has engaged with Red Hat Consulting. Information about internal infrastructure and security posture may now be in the hands of malicious actors.
- **ATT&CK:**
    *   T1199: Trusted Relationship (Exploiting the Red Hat-customer relationship)
    *   T1537: Transfer Data to Cloud Account
    *   T1658: Extortion
- **Detection ideas:**
    *   Monitor for any unusual scanning or login attempts that correlate with information that might have been present in a Red Hat CER.
    *   Increase monitoring on systems and platforms that were part of Red Hat consulting engagements.
- **Mitigations:**
    *   Affected Red Hat customers should follow guidance provided by Red Hat.
    *   Organizations should consider this a potential intelligence leak and review the security of systems documented in any consulting engagements with Red Hat.
    *   Prepare for potential phishing or social engineering attacks that leverage the stolen information for credibility.

### 6. Sector & Geo Risk Signals

- **Geopolitical (Europe):** A suspected China-linked cyber-espionage campaign has targeted government bodies in Serbia, Hungary, Belgium, Italy, and the Netherlands. The use of malware like Sogu, PlugX, and Korplug points to established Chinese state-sponsored actors. 【[https://therecord.media/suspected-chinese-spies-serbia](https://therecord.media/suspected-chinese-spies-serbia)】
- **Regulatory (EU):** Signal has stated it will exit the EU market if the proposed "Chat Control" regulation, which could undermine end-to-end encryption, is passed. A key vote is scheduled for October 14, with Germany's position being critical. This could have significant implications for secure communications within the EU. 【[https://therecord.media/signal-calls-on-germany-to-vote-no-chat-control](https://therecord.media/signal-calls-on-germany-to-vote-no-chat-control)】
- **Industry Trend (General):** A recent survey indicates a rising fear among businesses regarding AI-powered cyberattacks. More than half of companies reported they have already faced AI-driven phishing attacks, signaling a shift in the threat landscape that is driving AI to become a top cybersecurity investment priority. 【[https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/it-leaders-concern-ai-cyberattacks-survey/802151/](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/it-leaders-concern-ai-cyberattacks-survey/802151/)】

### 7. Third-Party & Supply Chain Notes

- **Red Hat:** The data breach at Red Hat represents a significant supply chain risk for its consulting customers. Sensitive information about their internal networks and infrastructure may have been stolen and could be used for future targeted attacks. 【[https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/red-hat-data-breach-escalates-as-shinyhunters-joins-extortion/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/red-hat-data-breach-escalates-as-shinyhunters-joins-extortion/)】
- **Discord:** A breach at an unnamed third-party customer service provider for Discord exposed user data, including names, emails, IP addresses, and billing information. This highlights the persistent risk posed by vendors with access to sensitive customer data. 【[https://securityaffairs.com/183039/data-breach/discord-discloses-third-party-breach-affecting-customer-support-data.html](https://securityaffairs.com/183039/data-breach/discord-discloses-third-party-breach-affecting-customer-support-data.html)】
- **Jaguar Land Rover:** The automotive manufacturer is preparing to resume manufacturing after a weeks-long shutdown caused by a cyberattack. The incident demonstrates the severe financial and operational impact of cyberattacks on complex manufacturing supply chains, with estimated revenue losses in the billions. 【[https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/06/jlr_phased_production/](https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/06/jlr_phased_production/)】

### 8. Detections & Response Playbook Updates

- **Detection Rules:**
    *   Prioritize ingesting IOCs from Oracle's advisory for CVE-2025-61882 into SIEM and EDR platforms.
    *   Develop and deploy detection logic for Medusa ransomware activity, as detailed in Microsoft's threat report on the GoAnywhere MFT exploitation.
- **Response Playbook Changes:**
    *   Update the incident response playbook for critical enterprise applications (e.g., ERP systems) to include immediate steps for network isolation of potentially compromised systems, especially in scenarios involving zero-day exploitation before a patch is available.
    *   Review and test the disaster recovery and business continuity plan for critical data repositories, referencing the NIRS fire in South Korea, which resulted in total data loss due to a lack of available backups. 【[https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2025-10-01/national/socialAffairs/NIRS-fire-destroys-governments-cloud-storage-system-no-backups-available/2412936](https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2025-10-01/national/socialAffairs/NIRS-fire-destroys-governments-cloud-storage-system-no-backups-available/2412936)】

### 10. Assumptions, Gaps, and Tasking

- **Assumption:** We assume that Cl0p's targeting of Oracle EBS is opportunistic and not targeted specifically at our sector. Confidence: Medium. This may change as more victim information becomes public.
- **Intelligence Gap:** The full list of Red Hat customers impacted by the GitLab breach is currently unknown.
- **Tasking:**
    *   Task vulnerability management team to immediately scan the entire environment for CVE-2025-61882, CVE-2025-10035, CVE-2025-49844, and all other new KEV entries. Report on findings and patch status by EOD.
    *   Task Threat Hunting team to proactively search for signs of compromise related to the Oracle EBS vulnerability, using IOCs from the vendor advisory, retroactive to August 1, 2025.
    *   Task Vendor Management team to formally request information from Red Hat regarding our organization's potential exposure in their recent data breach.
