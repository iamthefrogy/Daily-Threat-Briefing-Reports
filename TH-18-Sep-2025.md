#### OpenSSF Publishes Guide for Secure AI Code Assistant Instructions — Software Developers and Security Teams — Why it matters for secure software development
- **Facts:**
    *   The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) published a "Security-Focused Guide for AI Code Assistant Instructions." (Tenable, 2025-09-19T09:00:00 -0400)
    *   The guide aims to help developers prompt AI coding helpers securely to reduce the risk of generating unsafe code. (Tenable, 2025-09-19T09:00:00 -0400)
    *   It covers ensuring AI tools consider application code security (input validation, secret management), supply chain safety (safe dependencies), platform/language-specific considerations (container security), and security standards (OWASP, SANS). (Tenable, 2025-09-19T09:00:00 -0400)
    *   CISOs are generally concerned about AI adoption in business environments, with a UK survey showing 69% of employees use AI but only 42% trust it. (Tripwire, 2025-09-19 04:44:00 -0500)
- **Assessment:** We assess the likelihood of AI coding assistants introducing vulnerabilities as High (Confidence: High) without proper guidance. The OpenSSF guide (Impact: Medium-High as a preventative measure) is a valuable resource for mitigating this emerging risk in software development.
- **Relevance:** If our organization utilizes AI coding assistants, this guide is directly relevant to our secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC). Failing to use these tools securely could lead to the introduction of vulnerabilities into our applications, increasing our attack surface.
- **ATT&CK:** T1195.003 (Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Development Tools), T1584 (Compromise Developer Accounts). (Indirectly, as a preventative measure for these).
- **Detection ideas:**
    *   Integrate static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) into CI/CD pipelines to detect vulnerabilities introduced by AI-generated code.
    *   Perform code reviews with a specific focus on AI-generated components.
- **Mitigations:**
    *   Distribute and enforce the OpenSSF guide's recommendations for all developers using AI code assistants.
    *   Implement robust code review processes, ensuring human oversight of AI-generated code.
    *   Provide training for developers on secure prompting techniques for AI tools.
    *   Use secure development frameworks and libraries by default.

### 10. Assumptions, Gaps, and Tasking

- **Assumption:** We assume that Microsoft's patch for the Entra ID "Actor tokens" vulnerability was effective and implemented globally prior to the researcher's public disclosure. Confidence: High.
- **Gap:** We lack specific, immediately actionable IOCs (e.g., malware hashes, C2 domains) for the actively exploited Google Chrome zero-day and the Microsoft Entra ID vulnerability beyond general descriptions. This limits proactive hunting for historical compromise.
- **Gap:** Full visibility into all third-party browser extensions used by employees across the organization, making comprehensive mitigation against "Passkeys Pwned" implementation flaws challenging.
- **Tasking:**
    *   **IT Operations:** Prioritize completing all MySonicWall credential resets for remaining accounts. Verify all WatchGuard Firebox appliances are running patched OS versions.
    *   **Security Operations Center (SOC):** Integrate CISA's YARA/SIGMA rules for Ivanti EPMM malware into SIEM and EDR platforms. Conduct threat hunts for CountLoader malware TTPs.
    *   **Threat Intelligence (CTI) Team:** Follow up on the release of specific IOCs for the Chrome zero-day and the Entra ID bug. Continue monitoring for any public post-exploitation details or new attack vectors related to the "Passkeys Pwned" flaw.
    *   **Application Security Team:** Conduct an audit of all active browser extensions used within the organization. Review secure coding practices related to AI code assistants and integrate OpenSSF's guidance.
    *   **Identity & Access Management (IAM) Team:** Review Microsoft Entra ID audit logs for any suspicious activity pre-dating the Entra ID vulnerability patch, particularly around privileged role assignments or unexpected API calls.
