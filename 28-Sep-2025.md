### **2. Notable Events & Assessments**

#### **Akira Ransomware Exploits SonicWall VPNs with MFA Bypass — Global — Critical Risk of Rapid Network Encryption**

- **Facts:**
    *   The Akira ransomware group is conducting a "smash and grab" campaign targeting organizations using SonicWall SSL VPNs. Dwell time from initial access to ransomware deployment is exceptionally short, often under one hour 【[https://arcticwolf.com/resources/blog/smash-and-grab-aggressive-akira-campaign-targets-sonicwall-vpns/](https://arcticwolf.com/resources/blog/smash-and-grab-aggressive-akira-campaign-targets-sonicwall-vpns/) (2025-09-29T02:00:11Z)】【[https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/akira-ransomware-breaching-mfa-protected-sonicwall-vpn-accounts/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/akira-ransomware-breaching-mfa-protected-sonicwall-vpn-accounts/) (2025-09-28T14:49:30Z)】.
    *   Threat actors are successfully authenticating to accounts protected with one-time password (OTP) multi-factor authentication (MFA). Researchers suspect this may be due to the use of OTP seeds stolen previously from devices vulnerable to CVE-2024-40766, a vulnerability disclosed a year prior.
    *   Post-compromise, actors use tools like Impacket for rapid lateral movement via SMB, followed by the deployment of Akira ransomware.
- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess that this campaign poses an immediate and critical threat to any organization using SonicWall SSL VPNs. The ability to bypass MFA suggests a sophisticated approach to credential and token theft, rendering MFA partially ineffective if underlying secrets are compromised. **Confidence:** High.
    *   The extremely short dwell time indicates a highly automated attack chain, leaving defenders a minimal window to detect and respond before widespread encryption occurs. **Confidence:** High.
- **Relevance:**
    *   Any internet-facing SonicWall VPN appliance is a potential entry point for this attack. The speed of the attack neutralizes traditional, human-led response timelines.
- **ATT&CK:**
    *   T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application
    *   T1078: Valid Accounts
    *   T1556.006: Modify Authentication Process: Multi-Factor Authentication
    *   T1021.002: Remote Services: SMB/Windows Admin Shares
    *   T1486: Data Encrypted for Impact
- **Detection ideas:**
    *   Monitor VPN logs for suspicious authentications, especially those originating from unusual Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) related to hosting providers.
    *   Implement SIEM rules to detect rapid lateral movement immediately following a VPN connection. For example, `(EventCode=VPN_Login) followed by (Process: psexec.exe OR wmiexec.exe)` from the same source IP within minutes.
    *   Look for network traffic patterns indicative of Impacket tools communicating with domain controllers or other high-value assets.
- **Mitigations:**
    *   Immediately apply all available SonicWall patches.
    *   **Crucially, reset credentials for all VPN users**, as patches do not protect against the use of previously stolen credentials or OTP seeds.
    *   Implement network segmentation to limit the blast radius of a compromised VPN account.
    *   Enhance monitoring of post-VPN user activity for anomalous behavior.

#### **Malvertising Campaign Uses Fake Microsoft Teams Installers to Distribute Oyster Backdoor — All Sectors — Initial Access for Ransomware**

- **Facts:**
    *   Threat actors are using search engine advertisements and SEO poisoning to lure users into downloading fake Microsoft Teams installers from malicious websites 【[https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-microsoft-teams-installers-push-oyster-malware-via-malvertising/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-microsoft-teams-installers-push-oyster-malware-via-malvertising/) (2025-09-29T05:00:10Z)】.
    *   The malicious installers deploy the Oyster backdoor (also known as Broomstick or CleanUpLoader), which provides attackers with remote access, command execution, and file transfer capabilities.
    *   Oyster malware is a known precursor to major ransomware attacks and has been used by groups such as Rhysida.
- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess this is a highly effective initial access technique that leverages the widespread use and trusted name of Microsoft Teams. Employees looking to install or update the software are prime targets. **Confidence:** High.
    *   The use of Oyster as a foothold indicates that the ultimate goal is likely data theft and ransomware deployment. This is not a low-level threat and should be treated as a potential precursor to a major incident. **Confidence:** High.
- **Relevance:**
    *   Microsoft Teams is a standard business application in our environment. Any employee could fall victim to this malvertising campaign, creating an entry point into our network.
- **ATT&CK:**
    *   T1566.003: Phishing: via Malicious Link (from malvertising)
    *   T1204.002: User Execution: Malicious File
    *   T1105: Ingress Tool Transfer
    *   T1053: Scheduled Task/Job
- **Detection ideas:**
    *   Monitor DNS logs and web proxy data for connections to newly registered domains or domains impersonating Microsoft.
    *   Use EDR to detect suspicious child processes spawned by installers named `Teams.exe` or similar. For example, an installer should not be executing PowerShell commands to download further payloads from the internet.
    *   Hunt for persistence mechanisms commonly used by backdoors, such as the creation of new scheduled tasks or services.
- **Mitigations:**
    *   Implement strict user training to only download software from official sources (e.g., company software portal, Microsoft's official site).
    *   Use web filtering and ad-blocking solutions to reduce exposure to malvertising.
    *   Enforce application control/whitelisting to prevent the execution of unauthorized installers.

#### **Medusa Ransomware Claims Major Data Breach at Comcast — Telecommunications Sector — Potential Supply Chain and Customer Data Risk**

- **Facts:**
    *   The Medusa ransomware group has listed Comcast on its data leak site, claiming to have stolen 834 GB of data 【[https://hackread.com/medusa-ransomware-comcast-data-breach/](https://hackread.com/medusa-ransomware-comcast-data-breach/) (2025-09-28T23:41:43Z)】.
    *   The group is demanding a ransom of $1.2 million and has published screenshots and file listings as purported proof of the breach. Comcast has not yet publicly confirmed the incident.
- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess with medium confidence that the claim is credible, given Medusa's track record and the provision of alleged proof. A breach of this scale at a major telecommunications provider would have significant implications for millions of customers and business partners. **Confidence:** Medium.
- **Relevance:**
    *   As a potential customer or partner of Comcast, this incident could pose a direct or indirect risk. Employee or corporate data may have been exposed. This increases the likelihood of follow-on attacks such as targeted phishing or credential stuffing using compromised information.
- **ATT&CK:**
    *   T1213: Data from Information Repositories
    *   T1657: Financial Extortion
- **Detection ideas:**
    *   At present, detection is not possible as the breach occurred at a third party. Focus should be on monitoring for downstream effects.
- **Mitigations:**
    *   Issue a general awareness bulletin to employees to be on high alert for phishing emails that mention Comcast or reference a data breach.
    *   Review all business dependencies on Comcast services to understand potential operational impacts or data exposure points.

#### **Coordinated Cyberattacks Target UK Retailers — Retail Sector (UK) — Indication of a Sector-wide Campaign**

- **Facts:**
    *   British department store Harrods has warned customers of a data breach, disclosing that some personal details were compromised 【[https://www.securityweek.com/british-department-store-harrods-warns-customers-that-some-personal-details-taken-in-data-breach/](https://www.securityweek.com/british-department-store-harrods-warns-customers-that-some-personal-details-taken-in-data-breach/) (2025-09-28T18:07:52Z)】.
    *   This follows a severe cyberattack in April 2025 against UK retailer Co-op, which resulted in empty shelves, stolen data, and an estimated $275 million in lost revenue. A group calling itself "DragonForce" claimed responsibility 【[https://securityaffairs.com/182713/security/cyberattack-on-co-op-leaves-shelves-empty-data-stolen-and-275m-in-lost-revenue.html](https://securityaffairs.com/182713/security/cyberattack-on-co-op-leaves-shelves-empty-data-stolen-and-275m-in-lost-revenue.html) (2025-09-28T16:25:49Z)】.
    *   Four individuals were arrested in July in connection with attacks on Harrods, Marks & Spencer, and Co-op, suggesting the incidents are linked.
- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess that a coordinated campaign is actively targeting the UK retail sector. The commonality of victims and the law enforcement action strongly suggest a connection between these high-impact incidents. **Confidence:** High.
- **Relevance:**
    *   This highlights a significant threat to the retail sector, particularly in the UK. Organizations operating in this sector or region should increase their vigilance and review security controls related to customer data and supply chain operations.
- **ATT&CK:**
    *   T1213: Data from Information Repositories
    *   T1078: Valid Accounts
    *   T1486: Data Encrypted for Impact
- **Detection ideas:**
    *   Monitor for common retail attack vectors, such as Magecart-style web skimming on e-commerce sites, Point-of-Sale (PoS) malware, and credential stuffing attacks against customer accounts.
- **Mitigations:**
    *   Ensure robust security measures for customer databases, including encryption and access controls.
    *   Regularly audit third-party vendor access to the network.
    *   Implement strong anti-fraud controls for customer-facing applications.

---

### **7. Third-Party & Supply Chain Notes**

- **Comcast:** The claimed breach by Medusa represents a potential third-party risk. If Comcast is a service provider, this incident could lead to the exposure of our data or impact service availability. Heightened monitoring for related phishing is recommended.
- **GitLab:** The critical vulnerabilities disclosed in GitLab represent a direct software supply chain risk. A compromise of a self-hosted instance could expose source code, CI/CD pipelines, and credentials, leading to a severe breach.

---

### **8. Detections & Response Playbook Updates**

- **Detection Rules:**
    *   **New SIEM Rule (TI-VPN-RapidLateralMovement):** A new correlation rule is recommended to alert when a user authenticates via VPN and is then associated with SMB/WMI remote execution activity (e.g., via Impacket) on the internal network within a 5-minute window.
- **Response Playbook Changes:**
    *   **Ransomware Playbook:** Update playbook to include an immediate action to disable all VPN access and terminate active sessions upon detection of ransomware activity originating from the VPN pool. Add a step for mandatory, fleet-wide password rotation for all VPN users if a systemic vulnerability is suspected.

---

### **9. Metrics & Hygiene**

- **Exposure Changes:**
    *   An urgent request has been sent to IT to inventory all internet-facing SonicWall VPN devices and their current patch levels.
- **Patch Status:**
    *   Patching for the critical GitLab vulnerabilities (P1) is underway. Current status: 3 identified instances, 1 confirmed patched, 2 pending confirmation. The 72-hour patching SLA is in effect.
- **Detection Alerts:**
    *   The SOC is actively hunting for behavioral indicators related to the Akira campaign. No confirmed related alerts have been generated in the last 24 hours.

---

### **10. Assumptions, Gaps, and Tasking**

- **Assumption:** We assume the MFA bypass in the Akira campaign is contingent on attackers possessing secrets (e.g., OTP seeds) stolen from SonicWall devices prior to being patched for CVE-2024-40766. This makes credential resets as critical as patching. **Confidence:** Medium.
- **Gap:** There is a lack of specific file hashes and C2 network indicators for the Akira and Oyster campaigns. This limits static detection and requires a heavier reliance on behavioral and heuristic monitoring.
- **Gap:** The data breach claim against Comcast has not been officially confirmed. The full scope and impact remain unknown.
- **Tasking:**
    *   **IT/Networking:** Provide a complete inventory of all SonicWall VPN appliances, including firmware versions and patch status, within 24 hours.
    *   **Threat Hunting Team:** Conduct a 30-day retroactive hunt for Impacket-like activity (e.g., `psexec.py`, `wmiexec.py`) originating from the user VPN IP address pool.
    *   **SOC:** Develop and deploy a detection rule to identify and alert on Microsoft Teams installers being downloaded from non-Microsoft domains.
