#### **Oracle EBS Under Active Exploitation by Clop Ransomware, Prompting Emergency Patch** — Global — High-Impact Extortion Campaign

- **Facts:**
    *   Oracle has released an emergency patch for a high-severity information disclosure vulnerability, CVE-2025-61884 (CVSS 7.5), in its E-Business Suite (EBS) versions 12.2.3 through 12.2.14. The flaw allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive data 【<https://securityaffairs.com/183362/security/oracle-issued-an-emergency-security-update-to-fix-new-e-business-suite-flaw-cve-2025-61884.html> (2025-10-14T07:31:14Z)】【<https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oracle-releases-emergency-patch-for-new-e-business-suite-flaw/> (2025-10-13T10:42:16Z)】.
    *   Separately, Harvard University confirmed it is investigating a data breach after the Clop ransomware group listed it on their leak site. The breach is linked to a zero-day vulnerability in Oracle EBS 【<https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/harvard-investigating-breach-linked-to-oracle-zero-day-exploit/> (2025-10-14T02:00:11Z)】【<https://therecord.media/harvard-says-limited-number-linked-to-data-theft> (2025-10-13T17:56:48Z)】.
    *   Google and Mandiant researchers have linked the Clop extortion campaign to the exploitation of another Oracle EBS zero-day, CVE-2025-61882, and other previously patched flaws. The campaign, which involves sending extortion emails to executives, may have started as early as July 2025 【<https://securityaffairs.com/183306/hacking/google-mandiant-expose-malware-and-zero-day-behind-oracle-ebs-extortion.html> (2025-10-13T08:35:36Z)】【<https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/oracle-e-business-suite-exploitation-july/802592/> (2025-10-10T10:33:03Z)】.

- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess with high confidence that the Clop ransomware group is systematically targeting vulnerabilities in Oracle's enterprise software for data theft and extortion campaigns, moving beyond simple encryption tactics. Rationale: The group has a documented history of exploiting flaws in widely used enterprise tools (e.g., MOVEit, GoAnywhere), and the current campaign targeting EBS follows this established playbook.
    *   We assess that the release of the emergency patch for CVE-2025-61884 is a direct response to the heightened threat environment created by Clop's ongoing exploitation of other EBS vulnerabilities. Rationale: Emergency patches are typically reserved for flaws under active or imminent exploitation, and the timing aligns with public disclosures of the EBS-related breaches.

- **Relevance:**
    *   This threat directly impacts organizations using Oracle E-Business Suite. The active exploitation and high-impact nature of data theft and extortion pose a significant financial and reputational risk.
    *   Exposure is via internet-facing EBS instances. A full asset inventory is required to identify all vulnerable systems.

- **ATT&CK:**
    *   T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application
    *   T1566: Phishing (Initial Access via extortion emails)
    *   T1071: Application Layer Protocol (Used by malware for C2)
    *   T1657: Financial Gain (Motive)

- **Detection Ideas:**
    *   Monitor web server access logs for EBS instances for unusual requests or patterns matching known exploits for Oracle products.
    *   Hunt for network connections from EBS servers to known malicious IP addresses or domains.
    *   Deploy application-level monitoring to detect anomalous behavior within the EBS environment, such as unauthorized data access or configuration changes.
    *   Sigma Rule Idea: Search for web access log entries containing exploit strings targeting the EBS BI Publisher component. `title: Oracle E-Business Suite Exploitation Attempt; logsource: category: webserver; detection: selection: c-uri|contains: '/OA_HTML/BneViewer' and c-uri|contains: 'bne:oafi' and c-uri|contains: 'bne:op' condition: selection`

- **Mitigations:**
    *   Apply the emergency patch for CVE-2025-61884 immediately to all affected Oracle E-Business Suite instances 【<https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2025-61884.html>】.
    *   Review Oracle's July 2025 Critical Patch Update and ensure all previously disclosed EBS vulnerabilities are patched.
    *   Restrict access to EBS applications from the public internet wherever possible. Use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect exposed instances.

#### **Widespread Credential Compromise Campaign Targets SonicWall SSL VPNs** — Global — Initial Access Threat

- **Facts:**
    *   Researchers have observed an ongoing, large-scale campaign compromising over 100 SonicWall SSL VPN accounts across at least 16 different environments since early October 2025 【<https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-vpn-accounts-breached-using-stolen-creds-in-widespread-attacks/> (2025-10-14T02:00:07Z)】.
    *   The attacks leverage valid, stolen credentials, suggesting a credential stuffing or password spraying attack rather than brute-forcing. The source of the credentials is unknown 【<https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/experts-warn-of-widespread-sonicwall.html> (2025-10-11T14:00:00Z)】.
    *   Post-compromise activity includes network scanning and attempts to access local Windows accounts, indicating the attackers are using the VPN access to perform internal reconnaissance 【<https://www.securityweek.com/sonicwall-ssl-vpn-accounts-in-attacker-crosshairs/> (2025-10-13T13:08:52Z)】.

- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess with high confidence that this campaign aims to secure initial access to corporate networks for subsequent attacks, such as ransomware deployment or data theft. Rationale: The observed post-compromise behavior (internal scanning) is a classic precursor to broader network intrusion and lateral movement.
    *   We assess that the use of local accounts on the VPN appliance, rather than directory-integrated accounts, poses a significant risk, as these are often overlooked and may have weak or non-rotated passwords. Rationale: The attacker's success across multiple environments suggests a common weak point, and local accounts are frequently mismanaged.

- **Relevance:**
    *   This is highly relevant to any organization using SonicWall SSL VPN appliances for remote access. A compromise provides a direct entry point into the internal network.

- **ATT&CK:**
    *   T1133: External Remote Services
    *   T1078.001: Valid Accounts: Default Accounts
    *   T1046: Network Service Discovery

- **Detection Ideas:**
    *   Monitor VPN authentication logs for multiple failed logins followed by a success from a single IP address (password spraying).
    *   Alert on successful VPN logins from geographically impossible locations or outside of normal business hours.
    *   Monitor for network scanning activity (e.g., port scans) originating from the VPN user IP address pool shortly after a new connection is established.

- **Mitigations:**
    *   **Immediately reset all local user passwords** on SonicWall appliances, not just those known to be compromised.
    *   **Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for all VPN users.
    *   Review and disable any dormant or unnecessary local user accounts on the VPN appliance.
    *   Update any secrets associated with IPSec, GroupVPN, or L2TP/PPPoE policies as recommended by SonicWall 【<https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-vpn-accounts-breached-using-stolen-creds-in-widespread-attacks/> (2025-10-14T02:00:07Z)】.

#### **Malicious Packages in Open-Source Repositories Exfiltrate Data via Discord** — Software Supply Chain — Data Theft

- **Facts:**
    *   Researchers have identified numerous malicious packages in the npm, PyPI, and RubyGems open-source repositories designed to steal developer data 【<https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/npm-pypi-and-rubygems-packages-found.html> (2025-10-14T07:39:00Z)】.
    *   These packages leverage Discord webhooks as a command-and-control (C2) and data exfiltration channel. Attackers embed a hardcoded webhook URL in the malicious code, which then transmits stolen secrets, environment variables, and other sensitive host data to an attacker-controlled Discord channel 【<https://gbhackers.com/threat-actors-exploit-discord-webhooks-for-c2/> (2025-10-12T15:48:12Z)】.
    *   This technique is attractive to attackers because it requires no custom C2 infrastructure and blends in with legitimate traffic to a popular service.

- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess with high confidence that using Discord webhooks for data exfiltration is a growing trend in software supply chain attacks due to its simplicity, reliability, and low probability of detection by traditional network security controls. Rationale: The ease of setup and the ubiquitous nature of Discord make it an ideal platform for covert communication channels.
    *   We assess that developer environments are a primary target for this type of attack, as they often contain credentials and access tokens for cloud services, source code repositories, and other high-value assets. Rationale: The exfiltrated data described in reports is specific to development contexts (e.g., secrets, host telemetry).

- **Relevance:**
    *   This threat is critical for organizations with software development teams that use packages from public repositories. A single compromised developer machine can lead to a significant breach of corporate intellectual property and infrastructure.

- **ATT&CK:**
    *   T1189: Drive-by Compromise (via typosquatting or dependency confusion)
    *   T1552: Unsecured Credentials
    *   T1071.001: Web Protocols (for C2 over HTTPS to Discord)
    *   T1539: Steal Web Session Cookie

- **Detection Ideas:**
    *   Monitor and restrict outbound network connections from build servers, CI/CD pipelines, and developer workstations to `discord.com/api/webhooks/`.
    *   Implement egress filtering and anomaly detection to identify large or unusual data transfers to collaboration platforms like Discord.
    *   Use code scanning tools to search for hardcoded URLs, especially those pointing to Discord webhooks, within third-party dependencies.
    *   SIEM Query: `destination.domain = "discord.com" AND url.path CONTAINS "/api/webhooks/" AND source.ip NOT IN (list_of_authorized_ips)`

- **Mitigations:**
    *   Vet all third-party dependencies before inclusion in projects. Use tools that scan for known malicious packages.
    *   Educate developers on the risks of typosquatting and dependency confusion.
    *   Implement the principle of least privilege in developer environments to limit the impact of a compromise.

    *   **Typical TTPs:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in third-party services (e.g., claimed Salesforce vulnerability), data theft, and public extortion. Operates data leak sites and forums.
    *   **Recent Activity:** Leaked data allegedly stolen from Qantas Airways, Vietnam Airlines, and others. Announced a new "Extortion-as-a-Service" platform. Their primary forum, BreachForums, was recently seized by the FBI and French Gendarmerie.
    *   **Confidence:** High

### 6. Sector & Geo Risk Signals

- **Healthcare:** SimonMed Imaging is notifying 1.2 million patients of a data breach from January 2025, linked to the Medusa ransomware group 【<https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/simonmed-says-12-million-patients-impacted-in-january-data-breach/>】.
- **Education:** Harvard University is the latest high-profile victim in a campaign targeting a vulnerability in Oracle E-Business Suite, highlighting the sector's exposure through widely used enterprise software 【<https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/harvard-investigating-breach-linked-to-oracle-zero-day-exploit/>】.
- **Geopolitical (UK):** The UK has experienced a record number of "nationally significant" cyberattacks, prompting the government to formally write to business leaders urging them to improve their cyber defenses 【<https://therecord.media/uk-hit-by-record-number-significant-cyberattacks>】.
- **Geopolitical (Ukraine):** Ukraine's parliament is advancing legislation to create a dedicated military Cyber Force, formalizing its offensive and defensive cyber capabilities and aligning more closely with NATO standards 【<https://therecord.media/ukraine-takes-steps-dedicated-cyber-force>】.
- **Regulatory (UK):** UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has fined 4chan for noncompliance with the Online Safety Act, signaling stricter enforcement of platform responsibility laws 【<https://therecord.media/4chan-fined-ofcom-uk-online-safety-act>】.

### 7. Third-Party & Supply Chain Notes

- **Open-Source Software:** Active campaigns are underway to publish malicious packages to npm, PyPI, and RubyGems. These packages are designed to steal developer credentials and exfiltrate data using Discord, posing a direct threat to any organization's software development lifecycle 【<https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/npm-pypi-and-rubygems-packages-found.html>】.
- **Unity Technologies:** The company confirmed that malicious code on its SpeedTree website skimmed payment data and other sensitive information from hundreds of customers, representing a compromise at a key vendor for the video game development industry 【<https://securityaffairs.com/183349/data-breach/customer-payment-data-stolen-in-unity-technologiess-speedtree-website-compromise.html>】.
- **Salesforce Ecosystem:** The extortion group SLH claims its recent high-profile data leaks (Qantas, etc.) stemmed from a Salesforce vulnerability. While unconfirmed if this is a core platform issue or customer-side misconfiguration, it highlights the significant risk associated with major SaaS providers and their integrated applications 【<https://hackread.com/shinyhunters-leak-data-qantas-vietnam-airlines-others/>】.

### 8. Detections & Response Playbook Updates

- **New Detection Rule:**
    *   **ID:** `TI_Linux_Suspicious_Outbound_DiscordWebhook_1025`
    *   **Purpose:** Detects and alerts on outbound POST requests to `discord.com/api/webhooks/` from production servers, CI/CD runners, or other non-standard assets. This is indicative of the exfiltration technique used by malicious npm/PyPI packages.
    *   **Pseudo-Query:** `SELECT * FROM network_logs WHERE destination.domain = "discord.com" AND http.request.method = "POST" AND url.path CONTAINS "/api/webhooks/" AND source.asset_type IN ("server", "build_agent")`
- **Response Playbook Update:**
    *   **Playbook:** `IRP-07: VPN Compromise`
    *   **Change:** Added a mandatory step to immediately reset passwords for **all** local accounts on the affected VPN appliance, not just the single compromised account. This addresses the tactic observed in the SonicWall campaign where attackers may have access to multiple stolen credentials. Reference: SonicWall security checklist 【<https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-vpn-accounts-breached-using-stolen-creds-in-widespread-attacks/>】.

***

### 9. Metrics & Hygiene

- **Exposure Changes:**
    *   **Critical Hygiene Alert:** Microsoft has officially ended support for Windows 10 as of October 2025. All remaining Windows 10 systems are now considered legacy and at high risk from unpatched vulnerabilities.
    *   **Action Item:** Generate a report of all corporate assets still running Windows 10 and prioritize their upgrade to Windows 11 or decommissioning. Metric to track: `% of endpoints on unsupported OS`.
- **Patch Status:**
    *   **Urgent Priority:** Patching for Oracle EBS vulnerability CVE-2025-61884 is now the highest priority. Metric to track: `Time-to-patch for CVE-2025-61884`. The target should be under 24 hours due to active exploitation of related flaws.

***

### 10. Assumptions, Gaps, and Tasking

- **Assumption:** We assume the widespread SonicWall VPN compromises are due to credentials stolen from a third-party breach (infostealer logs or a breached service) rather than a vulnerability in the SonicWall product itself, as reporting focuses on "valid credentials." Confidence: Medium.
- **Intelligence Gap:** The initial access vector used by Clop to exploit the Oracle EBS zero-day (CVE-2025-61882) is not fully detailed in open-source reporting.
- **Tasking:**
    *   **Task IT/Application Owners:** Immediately identify all Oracle E-Business Suite instances and apply the emergency patch for CVE-2025-61884.
    *   **Task IT Security/Network Team:** Initiate password resets for all local accounts on all internet-facing SonicWall VPN devices and ensure MFA is enforced across the entire user base.
    *   **Task Threat Hunting Team:** Proactively hunt for TTPs and IOCs associated with TA585 and MonsterV2 malware as detailed in the Proofpoint report.
