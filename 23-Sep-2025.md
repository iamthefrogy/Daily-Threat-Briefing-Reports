- **Title:** Active Exploitation of Pandoc SSRF Flaw (CVE-2025-51591) — Affects Cloud Environments — Threat Actors Stealing EC2 IAM Credentials
- **Facts:**
    *   A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability, CVE-2025-51591 (CVSS 6.5), in the popular document conversion utility Pandoc is being actively exploited in the wild【[https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/hackers-exploit-pandoc-cve-2025-51591.html](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/hackers-exploit-pandoc-cve-2025-51591.html) (2025-09-24 12:45:00 UTC)】.
    *   Attackers are leveraging the vulnerability to make requests to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Instance Metadata Service (IMDS)【[https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/hackers-exploit-pandoc-cve-2025-51591.html](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/hackers-exploit-pandoc-cve-2025-51591.html) (2025-09-24 12:45:00 UTC)】.
    *   By querying the IMDS, attackers can steal temporary IAM credentials associated with the EC2 instance, which can then be used to access other AWS resources【[https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/hackers-exploit-pandoc-cve-2025-51591.html](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/hackers-exploit-pandoc-cve-2025-51591.html) (2025-09-24 12:45:00 UTC)】.
- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess with **high confidence** that this vulnerability poses a significant risk to cloud applications that use Pandoc to process untrusted user input. The active exploitation confirms its practicality as an attack vector for cloud compromise.
    *   The impact of a successful attack is severe, as it grants the attacker the same level of access to AWS resources as the compromised EC2 instance. This could lead to data exfiltration, resource hijacking, or further lateral movement within the cloud environment.
- **Relevance:** This is relevant to any of our applications or services, particularly in AWS, that use the Pandoc library for file conversion. An attacker could upload a malicious file to a web application, trigger the vulnerability, and gain access to our cloud infrastructure.
- **ATT&CK:**
    *   T1595.002: Vulnerability Scanning
    *   T1213: Data from Information Repositories
    *   T1552.005: Cloud API Credentials

#### **New "EDR-Freeze" Tool Suspends Security Software via Windows Error Reporting**
- **Title:** New Defense Evasion Technique "EDR-Freeze" Emerges — Affects Endpoint Security Visibility — Bypasses Kernel Drivers
- **Facts:**
    *   A new proof-of-concept tool and technique named "EDR-Freeze" demonstrates how to suspend Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and antivirus processes from user mode【[https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-edr-freeze-tool-uses-windows-wer-to-suspend-security-software/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-edr-freeze-tool-uses-windows-wer-to-suspend-security-software/) (2025-09-24 05:00:12 UTC)】.
    *   The technique abuses the legitimate Microsoft Windows Error Reporting (WER) system and the `MiniDumpWriteDump` API to place security agent processes into an indefinite suspended state【[https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-edr-freeze-tool-uses-windows-wer-to-suspend-security-software/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-edr-freeze-tool-uses-windows-wer-to-suspend-security-software/) (2025-09-24 05:00:12 UTC)】【[https://www.scworld.com/brief/security-software-circumvented-by-novel-edr-freeze-tool](https://www.scworld.com/brief/security-software-circumvented-by-novel-edr-freeze-tool) (2025-09-23 18:12:32 UTC)】.
    *   This method does not require a vulnerable driver, making it a potentially stealthy and reliable way for attackers to disable defenses before executing malicious actions【[https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-edr-freeze-tool-uses-windows-wer-to-suspend-security-software/](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-edr-freeze-tool-uses-windows-wer-to-suspend-security-software/) (2025-09-24 05:00:12 UTC)】.
- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess with **high confidence** that this technique will be adopted by threat actors. Its reliance on legitimate system components makes it difficult to detect with simple signature-based methods.
    *   By "freezing" EDR, an attacker can effectively blind the SOC to subsequent activities on the compromised endpoint, such as credential dumping, lateral movement, and ransomware deployment. This significantly increases the likelihood of a successful breach.
- **Relevance:** This technique directly threatens the effectiveness of our endpoint security stack. If our EDR solution is vulnerable to this method, it creates a critical visibility gap that attackers can exploit.
- **ATT&CK:**
    *   T1562.001: Disable or Modify Tools
    *   T1055: Process Injection (via API abuse)
- **Detection ideas:**
    *   Hunt for suspicious processes (e.g., non-debuggers) calling the `MiniDumpWriteDump` API against EDR/AV processes.
    *   Monitor for the creation of unexpected dump files related to security agents.
    *   Monitor for events where Windows Error Reporting (`WerFault.exe` or `wermgr.exe`) is invoked to target security product processes. Look for parent/child process relationships that are abnormal.
- **Mitigations:**
    *   Engage with our EDR vendor to understand if their product is susceptible and when protections will be implemented.
    *   Implement detection rules based on the hunting ideas above to identify potential abuse of the WER framework.
    *   Ensure EDR tampering protection features are enabled and configured to their highest level.

### 10. Assumptions, Gaps, and Tasking

- **Assumption:** We assume the list of npm packages compromised by "Shai-Hulud" is still incomplete and will grow. Our response must be based on detecting the malware's behavior, not just a static list of packages. (Confidence: High).
- **Gap:** We lack centralized visibility into all third-party libraries and dependencies being used across all development projects, making a comprehensive audit for the npm compromise challenging.
- **Tasking:**
    *   Task IT and DevOps to provide an inventory of all instances of Libraesva ESG, SolarWinds Web Help Desk, and applications using the Pandoc library by end of day.
    *   Task the Development Security team to deploy a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) tool to scan all active repositories and identify exposure to the "Shai-Hulud" worm.
    *   Task the Threat Hunting team to proactively search for evidence of the EDR-Freeze technique in endpoint logs from the past 30 days.
