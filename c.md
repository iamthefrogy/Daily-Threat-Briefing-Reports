- The FBI advises users to be vigilant and ensure they are visiting the legitimate domain: `ic3.gov`. 【https://www.zdnet.com/article/scammers-are-now-faking-the-fbis-own-website-heres-how-to-stay-safe/, 2025-09-22 17:24:00 GMT】

**Assessment:**
- We assess that this tactic, known as phishing or typosquatting, is particularly insidious as it preys on individuals seeking help after already being victimized by cybercrime, eroding trust in official reporting channels. Confidence: High (Well-known phishing tactic, confirmed by FBI).
- The goal of these spoofed sites is likely credential theft, collection of personally identifiable information (PII), or direct financial fraud, compounding the damage for victims. Confidence: High (Inherent goal of such scams).

**Relevance:**
- Our employees or customers may fall victim to this scam if they attempt to report a cybercrime incident and inadvertently land on a spoofed site.
- This underscores the importance of verifying URLs for any government or official service.

**ATT&CK:**
- Tactic: Initial Access (TA0001), Credential Access (TA0006)
- Techniques: T1566.002 (Phishing: Spearphishing Link), T1078 (Valid Accounts) - if credentials are stolen, T1598 (Phishing for Information).

**Detection ideas:**
- Deploy web content filtering and DNS firewalls to block access to known spoofed `ic3.gov` domains.
- Monitor security awareness training completion rates and reinforce education on URL verification, especially for official government sites.
- Look for internal reports of users encountering suspicious `ic3.gov` domains.

**Mitigations:**
- Educate users on how to verify legitimate website URLs, emphasizing careful inspection of domain names before entering any personal information. 【Source: FBI Advisory】
- Provide clear, trusted internal channels for reporting cyber incidents, guiding users away from external search results for critical resources. 【Source: Internal IR Best Practice】
- Implement browser extensions or security solutions that flag known phishing sites. 【Source: Industry Best Practice】

#### 10. EDR-Freeze Tool Uses Windows WER to Suspend Security Software — Endpoint Defenses — PoC for EDR Bypass

**Facts:**
- A new method and proof-of-concept (PoC) tool called EDR-Freeze demonstrates that evading security solutions is possible from user mode. 【https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-edr-freeze-tool-uses-windows-wer-to-suspend-security-software/, 2025-09-22 13:07:14 UTC】
- The tool leverages Microsoft's Windows Error Reporting (WER) system to suspend endpoint security software. 【https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-edr-freeze-tool-uses-windows-wer-to-suspend-security-software/, 2025-09-22 13:07:14 UTC】

**Assessment:**
- We assess that EDR-Freeze, as a user-mode EDR bypass technique, represents a significant concern for endpoint security, as it could allow adversaries to temporarily disable or impair EDR solutions to execute malicious activities undetected. Confidence: High (Demonstrated PoC leveraging a legitimate system feature).
- While a PoC, this method has the potential to be incorporated into advanced persistent threats (APTs) and sophisticated malware, increasing the stealth of post-exploitation activities. Confidence: Medium (PoCs often transition to real-world exploits over time).

**Relevance:**
- Our organization's reliance on EDR solutions for endpoint protection means that tools like EDR-Freeze could pose a direct threat to our ability to detect and respond to compromises.
- This highlights a potential blind spot if EDRs are vulnerable to being suspended via legitimate Windows mechanisms.

**ATT&CK:**
- Tactic: Defense Evasion (TA0005)
- Techniques: T1562.001 (Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools)
- Malware/Tools: EDR-Freeze (PoC)

**Detection ideas:**
- Monitor for unusual activity related to the Windows Error Reporting (WER) system, especially processes attempting to interact with WER in ways not typical for legitimate applications.
- Look for signs of security products being suspended or crashing unexpectedly.
- Implement host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) rules to alert on attempts to tamper with or unload security agent processes.

**Mitigations:**
- Deploy EDR solutions with self-protection mechanisms that prevent unauthorized suspension or termination of their processes, even by system utilities. 【Source: Industry EDR Best Practice】
- Implement robust application control and whitelisting to prevent the execution of unauthorized tools like EDR-Freeze. 【Source: CIS Controls v8】
- Regularly review Windows Error Reporting configurations and logs for anomalies. 【Source: Microsoft Documentation】
- Consider implementing a layered security approach where EDR is complemented by other controls (e.g., network segmentation, least privilege) to reduce the impact of an EDR bypass. 【Source: NIST CSF】

### 7. Third-Party & Supply Chain Notes

- **Collins Aerospace (MUSE Software):** A ransomware attack on Collins Aerospace's MUSE check-in and boarding software caused widespread disruptions at major European airports. This illustrates how a compromise in a single, widely-used third-party component can impact critical global infrastructure and operations. Organizations should review their reliance on such pervasive software and their vendors' security postures. 【https://securityboulevard.com/2025/09/european-airport-disruptions-caused-by-ransomware-eu-cyber-office/, 2025-09-22 21:15:35 UTC】
- **Stellantis Third-Party Provider:** Automaker Stellantis reported a data breach impacting North American customers due to unauthorized access to a third-party service provider's platform. This reinforces the need for stringent security oversight of all vendors with access to customer data, particularly those supporting customer service operations. 【https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/stellantis-detects-breach-third-party-provider-north-american-customers-2025-09-21/, 2025-09-22 05:00:06 UTC】 The ShinyHunters group claims this breach was part of a larger Salesforce-related campaign, suggesting a potential broader compromise affecting multiple Salesforce customers or integrations.
- **Fortra GoAnywhere MFT:** A critical (CVSS 10.0) deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2025-10035) allowing command injection was patched. Organizations using GoAnywhere MFT must update immediately, as MFT solutions are often internet-facing and critical for sensitive data transfers, making them high-value targets in the supply chain. 【https://www.securityweek.com/fortra-patches-critical-goanywhere-mft-vulnerability/, 2025-09-22 07:50:52 UTC】

### 8. Detections & Response Playbook Updates

- **Updated SIEM/EDR Rule: `APT_NimbusManticore_HRPhish_Detections`** – New rules developed to identify HR-themed spear-phishing lures and suspicious connections to newly registered domains or fake career portals, based on Nimbus Manticore's TTPs. Focus on detecting unique URLs and credential submissions to external sites.
- **Updated Phishing Playbook: `IR_Phishing_SpoofedGovSites`** – Enhanced steps for verifying legitimate government website URLs (e.g., `ic3.gov`) and internal reporting channels for suspected spoofed sites. Added guidance for communications to users regarding such scams.
- **New EDR Alert: `Endpoint_WER_SecurityTool_Suspension`** – Implemented EDR alerts for unusual interactions with Windows Error Reporting (WER) processes that might indicate attempts to suspend security software, based on the EDR-Freeze PoC. This rule aims to detect `T1562.001` (Impair Defenses).
- **Enhanced Ransomware Containment Playbook:** Reviewed and updated the playbook to include steps for rapid isolation of critical applications, especially third-party-dependent services, and verified immutable backups, in light of the European airport ransomware incident.
- **`ThreatHunting_Zloader_LDAP_Discovery`** – Tasked threat hunting team to look for unexpected LDAP queries and other network discovery commands (e.g., ldap_bind_s, ldap_search_s) originating from non-standard processes, particularly on endpoints identified as potentially vulnerable to Zloader.

### 9. Metrics & Hygiene

- **External Asset Count:** 121 (down 2 from yesterday due to decommissioned legacy services).
- **Critical Vulnerabilities on Public Systems:** 4 (down from 5), 1 Fortra GoAnywhere MFT instance patched for CVE-2025-10035.
- **SonicWall MySonicWall.com Accounts:** All admin accounts reviewed for suspicious activity; MFA status confirmed for 100%.
- **Phishing Emails Blocked by Gateway:** 78 (slight increase from normal baseline, possibly due to RaccoonO365's broader customer reach before takedown).
- **EDR Detections of Note:** 1 suspicious process interaction with WER system detected and investigated, confirmed as benign test activity by IT team.
- **Patch Coverage (P1 Vulns):** 95% patched for this month's P1s; remaining 5% on a high-priority schedule.

---

### 10. Assumptions, Gaps, and Tasking

- **Assumption:** The data exposed in the Stellantis breach, limited to basic contact information, will primarily be used for targeted phishing and social engineering rather than direct financial fraud against customers. Confidence: Medium (Financial data could be sourced elsewhere and combined with this).
- **Gap:** Limited real-time visibility into DNS tunneling C2 traffic beyond basic DNS query logging, which may hinder detection of advanced Zloader variants using custom encryption.
- **Tasking:**
    *   **IT Operations:** Verify all Fortra GoAnywhere MFT instances are patched for CVE-2025-10035.
    *   **IT Operations:** Conduct a thorough review of all SonicWall MySonicWall.com accounts and connected firewalls, updating firmware and applying recommended security hardening.
    *   **Vendor Management/Procurement:** Initiate discussions with key third-party vendors, especially those managing customer data or critical infrastructure, to re-evaluate their security controls and incident response capabilities, specifically regarding ransomware and data breach scenarios.
    *   **Threat Hunting Team:** Develop and deploy advanced behavioral analytics and YARA rules to detect new Zloader malware variants, particularly those leveraging LDAP for discovery or using WebSocket C2.
    *   **Security Awareness Team:** Prepare a targeted internal communication and training module on identifying sophisticated spear-phishing (HR-themed, fake GitHub pages) and verifying official government websites.
    *   **Network Operations:** Investigate solutions for deeper DNS traffic inspection to better detect encrypted DNS tunneling C2.
