- The group consistently uses legitimate services (Google Sheets, Google Calendar, VS Code Remote Tunnels) for Command and Control (C2) to blend with legitimate traffic.
    *   [https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/going-underground-china-aligned-ta415-conducts-us-china-economic-relations](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/going-underground-china-aligned-ta415-conducts-us-china-economic-relations) (2025-09-18T05:00:06Z)

**Assessment:**
- We assess that TA415's use of legitimate tools like VS Code Remote Tunnels for C2 significantly complicates detection, as it allows them to operate "living off the cloud" and bypass traditional perimeter defenses. Confidence: High (Observed tactics align with established APT behaviors).
- The targeting suggests an ongoing intelligence collection effort related to US-China economic policy and trade. Confidence: High (Consistent with TA415's known motives).

**Relevance:**
- Organizations involved in government contracting, policy research, or academia, particularly those dealing with international relations, should be highly aware of this specific targeting.
- The use of VS Code Remote Tunnels highlights a supply chain/software usage risk; if developers use VS Code, its legitimate features can be abused.

**ATT&CK:**
- **T1566.001** - Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment / **T1566.002** - Phishing: Spearphishing Link (initial compromise)
- **T1136.002** - Create Account: Cloud Account (potentially for C2 infrastructure)
- **T1071.004** - Application Layer Protocol: DNS / **T1071.001** - Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols (C2 via legitimate services)
- **T1219** - Remote Access Software (VS Code Remote Tunnels)

**Detection ideas:**
- Monitor network logs for connections to VS Code Remote Tunnel services from non-developer machines or at unusual times.
- Inspect proxy/web gateway logs for unusual connections to legitimate services (Google Sheets, Calendar) that may indicate C2.
- Implement advanced email filtering to detect spearphishing attempts impersonating high-profile individuals or organizations.
- Review endpoint logs for suspicious process creation related to VS Code or other remote access tools on non-developer systems.

**Mitigations:**
- **Employee Training:** Educate employees, especially those in targeted roles, on advanced spearphishing and impersonation tactics.
- **Application Control:** Implement application whitelisting or strict controls over remote access tools and development software like VS Code on non-developer workstations.
- **Network Segmentation:** Isolate developer networks and systems from other critical business units.
- **Outbound Traffic Filtering:** Monitor and filter outbound connections, looking for anomalies to legitimate services that could be abused for C2.

### 8. Detections & Response Playbook Updates

- **Detection Rule Update (Endpoint):** Enhance SIEM/EDR rules to detect suspicious child processes spawned by web browsers (e.g., Chrome spawning `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe`) to address CVE-2025-10585 exploitation.
- **Detection Rule (Network):** Add monitoring for outbound connections from developer workstations to VS Code Remote Tunnel services (`*.vscode.dev` or similar) and unusual C2 traffic to legitimate services (Google Sheets/Calendar) to detect TA415 activity.
- **Detection Rule (Endpoint/Network):** Implement detection for common remote access tools (e.g., AnyDesk, TeamViewer) usage originating from unexpected user accounts or systems.
- **Response Playbook Enhancement:** Review and update playbooks for supply chain attacks to include steps for validating npm/PyPI package integrity and assessing impacts on internal codebases.
- **Response Playbook Enhancement:** Update credential theft and account compromise playbooks to include immediate actions for third-party service credential resets (e.g., MySonicWall) and M365 account compromise scenarios.

---

### 9. Metrics & Hygiene

- **External Asset Count:** 137 (up 4 from yesterday due to new cloud asset discovery). 7 critical vulnerabilities still unpatched on public systems (down from 8).
- **Patch Coverage:** Chrome browser versions across environment: 85% updated (target 95% by EOD tomorrow). Pending P1 vulnerability patches for Firebox, Nokia, Jenkins: 60% completion.
- **Detection Alerts:** Phishing email attempts blocked: 72 (slight increase from normal, possibly related to ongoing PhaaS activity). EDR detections of note: 1 suspicious PowerShell execution (investigated, determined to be legitimate admin activity), 1 unauthorized external connection attempt (blocked by firewall, source from known C2 IP).
- **MFA Coverage:** 98% of critical accounts enabled with MFA (consistent). Reviewing non-phishing-resistant MFA methods for upgrade.

---

### 10. Assumptions, Gaps, and Tasking

- **Assumption:** We assume that the majority of our users are running Google Chrome and are susceptible to CVE-2025-10585 exploitation until patched. Confidence: High (Based on endpoint inventory).
- **Gap:** Limited real-time visibility into the integrity of third-party npm/PyPI packages used in our development pipeline. This could lead to delayed detection of supply chain compromises like "Shai-Hulud" or SilentSync RAT.
- **Tasking:** Request IT Operations to verify and report on the patch status of all Chrome installations and WatchGuard Firebox appliances by EOD today.
- **Tasking:** Task Development Security team to implement automated scanning for npm/PyPI package vulnerabilities and integrity checks in the CI/CD pipeline within the next 7 days.
- **Tasking:** Request the Identity & Access Management team to review all MySonicWall accounts (if applicable) and enforce MFA, followed by a mandatory password reset for all users.
- **Tasking:** Task Threat Hunting team to search for historical evidence of VS Code Remote Tunnel usage or connections to TA415-associated C2 domains from non-developer machines over the last 90 days.
- **Assumption:** Our organization is not directly targeted by TA415 due to limited involvement in US-China economic policy. Confidence: Medium (This could change if our activities align more closely with their targeting criteria).
