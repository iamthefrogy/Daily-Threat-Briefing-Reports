### 2. Notable Events & Assessments

#### **Critical Vulnerability in Microsoft Entra ID Could Allow Global Tenant Compromise**
- **Title:** Design Flaw in Microsoft Entra ID Could Allow Global Admin Access to Any Tenant
- **Facts:**
    *   A security researcher discovered a critical vulnerability in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) involving undocumented "Actor tokens" used for backend service-to-service communication.【https://dirkjanm.io/obtaining-global-admin-in-every-entra-id-tenant-with-actor-tokens/ (2025-09-19 02:00:13 UTC)】
    *   A flaw in the legacy Azure AD Graph API failed to properly validate the originating tenant, allowing these tokens to be used for cross-tenant access.【https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/09/19/microsoft_entra_id_bug/ (2025-09-19 12:30:06 UTC)】
    *   An attacker could request a token in their own tenant and use it to authenticate as any user, including Global Administrators, in any other Entra ID tenant.【https://dirkjanm.io/obtaining-global-admin-in-every-entra-id-tenant-with-actor-tokens/ (2025-09-19 02:00:13 UTC)】
    *   The researcher states that these Actor tokens are not subject to security policies like Conditional Access, meaning no configuration could have mitigated the attack. The vulnerability has since been fixed by Microsoft.【https://dirkjanm.io/obtaining-global-admin-in-every-entra-id-tenant-with-actor-tokens/ (2025-09-19 02:00:13 UTC)】
- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess this was one of the most severe vulnerabilities conceivable for a cloud identity provider, as it effectively bypassed tenant isolation and all preventative security controls. **Confidence:** High (Based on detailed technical analysis from a reputable researcher).
    *   While Microsoft has patched the flaw, the disclosure of the "Actor token" mechanism itself may inspire further research into undocumented Entra ID components, potentially leading to new attack vectors. **Confidence:** Medium (This is a logical inference based on how vulnerability research progresses).
- **Relevance:**
    *   This vulnerability affected the core of our identity and access management infrastructure. Any successful exploitation before the patch would have resulted in a complete compromise of our cloud environment.
- **ATT&CK:**
    *   T1078: Valid Accounts
    *   T1136.003: Create Account: Cloud Account
    *   T1484: Domain Policy Modification
    *   T1098.001: Steal Application Access Token
- **Detection ideas:**
    *   Review Entra ID sign-in logs and audit logs for anomalous Global Administrator activities or unexpected application authentications preceding the patch date.
    *   Monitor for any public indicators of compromise related to this vulnerability, though none are currently available.
- **Mitigations:**
    *   The vulnerability was fixed by Microsoft on the backend; no direct customer action is required to patch.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege for all Entra ID roles to limit the impact of any future identity-related vulnerabilities.

    *   The actors accessed customer firewall preference files stored in the cloud. These files contain configuration information that could significantly aid attackers in exploiting customer firewalls.【https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/sonicwall-breached-firewall-backup (2025-09-18 19:26:36 UTC)】
    *   The company states that fewer than 5% of its install base was affected and that it has blocked the attackers' access.【https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/sonicwall-urges-password-resets-after.html (2025-09-18 19:42:00 UTC)】
    *   SonicWall is urging all customers to perform an "essential credential reset" for MySonicWall.com accounts.【https://securityaffairs.com/182329/data-breach/sonicwall-warns-customers-to-reset-credentials-after-mysonicwall-backups-were-exposed.html (2025-09-18 14:14:21 UTC)】
- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess this incident poses a high risk to affected customers, as exposed configuration files provide attackers with a detailed blueprint of a target's network defenses, including firewall rules, user accounts, and VPN settings. **Confidence:** High (Based on the vendor's own disclosure and the nature of the exposed data).
    *   Even if full configuration files were not exfiltrated, metadata or partial files could reveal OS versions, patch levels, and enabled services, facilitating targeted vulnerability exploitation. **Confidence:** Medium (This is a reasonable inference about the utility of partial configuration data).
- **Relevance:**
    *   Our organization utilizes SonicWall firewalls. The potential exposure of our firewall configurations represents a direct and severe supply-chain risk, potentially enabling attackers to bypass our perimeter security.
- **ATT&CK:**
    *   T1589: Gather Victim Org Information
    *   T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application
    *   T1078: Valid Accounts
- **Detection ideas:**
    *   Monitor SonicWall firewall logs for any unauthorized login attempts or configuration changes, particularly from unusual IP addresses.
    *   Audit firewall rules for any recent modifications that weaken the security posture.
- **Mitigations:**
    *   Immediately reset all passwords for MySonicWall.com accounts.
    *   Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all SonicWall administrative accounts.
    *   Review all firewall configurations for security best practices and ensure devices are fully patched.

#### **UK Law Enforcement Arrests Two Teenage Members of 'Scattered Spider' Cybercrime Group**
- **Title:** Key Members of Prolific 'Scattered Spider' Hacking Group Arrested in the UK
- **Facts:**
    *   UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) arrested two teenagers, Thalha Jubair (19) and Owen Flowers (18), for their alleged involvement with the cybercrime group known as Scattered Spider.【https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uk-arrests-scattered-spider-teens-linked-to-transport-for-london-hack/ (2025-09-19 02:00:08 UTC)】
    *   The arrests are linked to the August 2024 cyberattack on Transport for London (TfL).【https://securityaffairs.com/182341/security/uk-police-arrested-two-teen-scattered-spider-members-linked-to-the-2024-attack-on-transport-for-london.html (2025-09-19 10:54:52 UTC)】
    *   Owen Flowers also faces charges in the U.S. for allegedly conspiring to attack healthcare companies, including SSM Health Care Corporation and Sutter Health, and is linked to at least 120 attacks resulting in over $115 million in ransoms.【https://www.securityweek.com/two-scattered-spider-suspects-arrested-in-uk-one-charged-in-us/ (2025-09-19 09:27:35 UTC)】【https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/us-uk-charge-scattered-spider/ (2025-09-18 16:10:00 UTC)】
    *   Scattered Spider is known for its social engineering tactics, including vishing and SIM-swapping, to gain initial access before deploying ransomware.【https://cyberscoop.com/scattered-spider-teenagers-arrested-uk/ (2025-09-18 17:35:58 UTC)】
- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess that while these arrests are a significant disruption to a key node of Scattered Spider, the group operates as a loose collective, and its overall operations are likely to continue. The TTPs they employ are effective and will be adopted by remaining members and affiliates. **Confidence:** High (Based on the typical structure of such cybercrime groups and past law enforcement actions).
- **Relevance:**
    *   Scattered Spider targets large organizations across sectors and their success relies heavily on exploiting the human element (help desks, employees) rather than just technical vulnerabilities. This poses a persistent risk to our organization, requiring continuous user awareness and robust identity verification processes.
- **ATT&CK:**
    *   T1589: Gather Victim Identity Information
    *   T1656: Impersonation
    *   T1595: Active Scanning
    *   T1486: Data Encrypted for Impact (Ransomware)
- **Detection ideas:**
    *   Monitor for multiple, rapid MFA push notifications or password reset requests for a single user account, which can indicate an MFA fatigue or social engineering attempt.
    *   Scrutinize help desk tickets related to new device enrollment or MFA token resets.
- **Mitigations:**
    *   Implement number matching or other phishing-resistant MFA methods.
    *   Conduct regular employee training on identifying and reporting social engineering and vishing attempts.
    *   Establish strict verification protocols for help desk staff when handling password or MFA resets.

---

### 10. Assumptions, Gaps, and Tasking

- **Assumption:** We assume that the Microsoft Entra ID "Actor token" vulnerability was not widely exploited before it was patched, given the lack of public reporting. **Confidence:** Medium (Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence; exploitation could have occurred undetected).
- **Gap:** We lack sufficient visibility into the specific API calls made by third-party applications and AI agents integrated with our M365 environment, making it difficult to detect subtle data exfiltration like the "ShadowLeak" attack.
- **Tasking:**
    *   **Task IT Operations:** Confirm that all corporate endpoints have received the latest Google Chrome patch by end-of-day. Provide a report of non-compliant systems for manual remediation.
    *   **Task Threat Hunting:** Proactively hunt for process chains indicative of Chrome exploitation (e.g., `chrome.exe` -> `powershell.exe`) in EDR logs over the past 7 days.
    *   **Task GRC/Vendor Management:** Confirm with our SonicWall account team if our organization was part of the <5% affected by their recent cloud backup breach.
