#### Malicious Packages in npm and Rust Repositories Target Developers

**Facts:**
- Two malicious Rust crates, `faster_log` and `async_println`, were discovered on the official crates.io repository. They impersonated a legitimate library and contained code to scan for and exfiltrate Solana and Ethereum private keys. The packages were downloaded over 8,400 times. [https://socket.dev/blog/two-malicious-rust-crates-impersonate-popular-logger-to-steal-wallet-keys (2025-09-26T02:00:13Z)], [https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/malicious-rust-crates-steal-solana-and.html (2025-09-25T10:09:00Z)]
- Separately, an unofficial npm package named `postmark-mcp` was found to contain malicious code that exfiltrated users' email communications. [https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/unofficial-postmark-mcp-npm-silently-stole-users-emails/ (2025-09-25T16:23:34Z)]

**Assessment:**
- **We assess with high confidence that threat actors are increasingly targeting developers through software supply chain attacks by poisoning open-source repositories.** This technique provides an effective distribution method for malware aimed at stealing credentials, sensitive data, and cryptocurrency.
- **We assess that typosquatting and impersonation of popular libraries remain a primary tactic for these attacks, exploiting the fast-paced nature of modern software development.**

**Relevance:**
- Our development teams utilize both npm and Rust packages, making us susceptible to this type of supply chain attack.
- A compromise could lead to the theft of developer credentials, source code, or personal financial assets, which could then be used to facilitate a broader breach of our organization.

**ATT&CK:**
- T1195.001: Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools
- T1555.003: Credentials from Password Stores (targeting crypto wallets)
- T1114.001: Email Collection: Local Email Collection
- T1552: Unsecured Credentials

**Detection Ideas:**
- Implement software composition analysis (SCA) tools to scan for and alert on the use of known malicious or typosquatted packages.
- Monitor outbound network traffic from developer workstations and build environments for connections to known malicious endpoints, such as the C2 domain `mainnet[.]solana-rpc-pool[.]workers[.]dev`.

**Mitigations:**
- Establish and enforce a policy for vetting and approving third-party libraries before they are used in projects.
- Provide security training for developers on the risks of typosquatting and how to verify the authenticity of open-source packages.
- Utilize a private package repository to host approved versions of external dependencies, reducing direct exposure to public repositories.

### 6. Sector & Geo Risk Signals

- **Technology Sector:** Now the most targeted industry for DDoS attacks, surpassing the gaming sector in Q1-Q2 2025. [https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/tech-overtakes-gaming-as-top-ddos.html]
- **Retail Sector:** UK retailer Co-op reported a revenue loss of approximately $275 million (£206 million) following a cyberattack in April, highlighting the severe financial impact of security incidents in this vertical. [https://therecord.media/retailer-the-co-op-cyberattack-lost-revenue]
- **Finland:** The country is reportedly experiencing an ongoing DDoS attack campaign, alongside a municipal data exposure incident in the city of Riihimäki, where personal data of thousands of students and guardians from 2014 was exposed on an internal server with overly permissive access rights. [https://yle.fi/a/74-20184917], [https://www.epressi.com/tiedotteet/kaupungit-ja-kunnat/riihimaen-kaupungin-sisaisen-verkon-tiedostopalvelimen-kansiossa-on-ollut-liian-laajat-kayttooikeudet.html]

### 7. Third-Party & Supply Chain Notes

- **Volvo North America / Miljödata:** Volvo disclosed a data breach affecting employee records. The breach originated from a ransomware attack on its third-party HR software provider, Miljödata, demonstrating significant supply chain risk. [https://www.securityweek.com/volvo-group-employee-data-stolen-in-ransomware-attack/]
- **Open-Source Software Repositories:** The discovery of malicious packages on npm (for JavaScript) and crates.io (for Rust) underscores the ongoing threat to the software supply chain. Developers are at risk of incorporating credential-stealing code directly into applications. [https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-rust-packages-on-cratesio-steal-crypto-wallet-keys/]

### 8. Detections & Response Playbook Updates

- **New SIEM Rule:** Create detection logic to alert on web requests to Cisco ASA/FTD VPN endpoints that match patterns associated with CVE-2025-20362 exploitation. Refer to Cisco's detection guide for specifics.
- **Playbook Update (Ransomware):** The ransomware incident response playbook must be updated with a specific appendix for containing and recovering compromised VMware ESXi hosts, based on the TTPs of LockBit 5.0. Steps should include isolating the vCenter and affected hosts, and initiating restores from offline backups.
- **New Hunt Query:** Develop and run threat hunting queries to search developer environments for the presence of malicious package files (`faster_log`, `async_println`, `postmark-mcp`) in project dependency lists (`Cargo.toml`, `package.json`).

### 9. Metrics & Hygiene

- **External Exposure:** Patching status for all internet-facing Cisco ASA/FTD devices is now the top priority. Initial scan identified 14 potentially vulnerable devices; verification and patching are underway.
- **Patch Status:** Coverage for P1 vulnerabilities from the last patching cycle is at 98%. The remaining 2% are pending scheduled maintenance windows this weekend.
- **Detection Alerts:** No alerts related to the ArcaneDoor campaign have been observed in the last 24 hours. The SOC is on high alert and actively hunting for related activity. A minor spike in phishing alerts was noted, consistent with ongoing campaigns but unrelated to today's major threats.

### 10. Assumptions, Gaps, and Tasking

- **Assumption:** We assume the ArcaneDoor actor's primary motive is espionage and that destructive or disruptive payloads are unlikely but not impossible. (Confidence: Medium)
- **Gap:** We currently lack a comprehensive Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for all our in-house developed applications, making it difficult to rapidly identify exposure to malicious packages.
- **Tasking:**
    *   **IT Network Team:** Provide a definitive inventory of all Cisco ASA, FTD, IOS, and IOS XE devices on the network, including software versions, by EOD. Prioritize patching of all internet-facing ASA/FTD devices.
    *   **SOC/Threat Hunting Team:** Proactively hunt for IOCs and TTPs related to the ArcaneDoor campaign in firewall, proxy, and endpoint logs for the past 90 days.
    *   **DevSecOps Team:** Initiate a scan of all active code repositories to identify any use of the malicious npm and Rust packages detailed in this report. Propose a plan for implementing an automated SCA scanning solution within the next quarter.
