#### **Microsoft Dismantles 'RaccoonO365' Phishing-as-a-Service Operation**
- **Facts:**
    *   Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit (DCU), in partnership with Health-ISAC, has executed a takedown of 338 websites associated with a Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) platform known as RaccoonO365【<https://securityboulevard.com/2025/09/microsoft-dcus-takedown-of-raccoono365/> (2025-09-22 22:47:00 UTC)】.
    *   The operation began in summer 2024 and provided phishing kits designed to steal Microsoft 365 credentials and session cookies. At least 25 healthcare companies were targeted.
    *   The investigation identified Joshua Ogundipe of Nigeria as a key figure behind the service. The operators used Cloudflare for domain registration and reverse proxy services to hide their infrastructure.
    *   The service was advertised on Telegram, with subscription plans ranging from $355 for 30 days to $999 for 90 days. Despite the takedown, the operator appears to still be active, offering phishing services with guaranteed credential harvesting rates.
- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess that the RaccoonO365 takedown will cause a short-term disruption to criminals relying on this specific platform, but the PhaaS model will persist. **Confidence: High** (The operator is already adapting their business model, and the demand for such services remains high).
    *   The operation demonstrates the effectiveness of public-private partnerships in combating cybercrime infrastructure. The use of civil court orders to seize domains is a powerful tool for disruption. **Confidence: High** (This is a proven strategy successfully used by Microsoft's DCU in multiple takedowns).
