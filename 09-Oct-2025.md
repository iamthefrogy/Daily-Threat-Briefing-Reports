### 2. Notable Events & Assessments

#### Gladinet Zero-Day Actively Exploited for Remote Code Execution
- **What Happened:** Threat actors are actively exploiting a zero-day vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-11371, in Gladinet CentreStack and Triofox file-sharing products. The flaw is an unauthenticated Local File Inclusion (LFI) that can be chained to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) 【https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-exploiting-zero-day-in-gladinet-file-sharing-software/ (2025-10-10T19:08:12Z)】【https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/from-lfi-to-rce-active-exploitation.html (2025-10-10T10:04:00Z)】.
- **Who/What is Affected:** All versions of Gladinet CentreStack and Triofox prior to the patched releases are vulnerable. Researchers at Huntress observed active exploitation in the wild 【https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/from-lfi-to-rce-active-exploitation.html (2025-10-10T10:04:00Z)】.
- **Why it Matters:** This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to access and potentially execute code on servers running widely used enterprise file-sharing solutions, posing a critical risk of data theft and network compromise.

**Assessment:**
- We assess with **High Confidence** that this vulnerability presents a critical and immediate threat. Active, in-the-wild exploitation of an unauthenticated RCE flaw in a public-facing application is a worst-case scenario that requires urgent remediation.
- We assess that attackers are likely motivated by data exfiltration and potential ransomware deployment, given the typical targeting of enterprise file-sharing platforms.

**Relevance:**
- This is a direct threat to any organization using Gladinet or Triofox products for file synchronization and sharing. It also represents a supply-chain risk if used by partners or service providers.

**ATT&CK:**
- T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application

**Detection Ideas:**
- Monitor web server and application logs for suspicious requests containing directory traversal patterns (e.g., `../`, `..%2f`) targeting Gladinet endpoints.
- Hunt for child processes spawned by the Gladinet application process that are unusual, such as `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, or `sh`.

**Mitigations:**
- Update to the latest patched versions of Gladinet CentreStack and Triofox immediately. No workaround is available 【https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-exploiting-zero-day-in-gladinet-file-sharing-software/ (2025-10-10T19:08:12Z)】.
- Restrict access to the application from the internet if possible until patching can be completed.

#### FBI Seizes BreachForums, Disrupting Major Cybercrime Hub
- **What Happened:** The FBI, in coordination with international partners, has seized the domains of BreachForums, a prominent hacking forum 【https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-takes-down-breachforums-portal-used-for-salesforce-extortion/ (2025-10-10T08:24:16Z)】【https://therecord.media/breachforums-fbi-france-takedown-banner-scattered-spider-salesforce-leak (2025-10-10T17:24:57Z)】.
- **Who/What is Affected:** The takedown affects the entire cybercrime ecosystem that relied on the forum for leaking and selling stolen corporate data. The site was recently revived by the ShinyHunters group and was being used by the Scattered Spider threat actor to extort Salesforce customers 【https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/shinyhunters-feds-shutter-salesforce-extortion-site (2025-10-10T16:38:25Z)】.
- **Why it Matters:** This action disrupts a critical piece of infrastructure used by major threat actors for data extortion campaigns, although the actors themselves remain at large and are expected to regroup.

**Assessment:**
- We assess with **High Confidence** that this takedown will cause a short-term disruption for data leak monetization and threat actor collaboration. The cybercrime community is resilient and will likely migrate to alternative forums or create new ones.
- We assess with **Medium Confidence** that the underlying threat from actors like ShinyHunters and Scattered Spider remains undiminished. While their primary platform is gone, their extortion threats against victims remain active, and they will adapt their TTPs 【https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/shinyhunters-feds-shutter-salesforce-extortion-site (2025-10-10T16:38:25Z)】.

**Relevance:**
- The takedown reduces the immediate visibility of ongoing data breaches but does not eliminate the risk. Organizations must remain vigilant for direct extortion attempts from threat actors who previously used this platform.

**ATT&CK:**
- This event is a law enforcement action against infrastructure supporting various TTPs, rather than an exhibition of actor TTPs itself.

**Detection Ideas:**
- Monitor for threat actor communications on emerging replacement forums or private channels (e.g., Telegram).
- Continue monitoring for organizational data appearing on other dark web markets.

**Mitigations:**
- No direct mitigations. This event serves as an intelligence signal about the operational security challenges faced by cybercriminals.

#### RondoDox Botnet Emerges with "Exploit Shotgun" Strategy
- **What Happened:** A new botnet named RondoDox is conducting a large-scale campaign using an "exploit shotgun" approach, simultaneously targeting 56 different known vulnerabilities across more than 30 types of devices 【https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/rondodox-botnet-exploit-edge-vulns (2025-10-10T19:22:57Z)】【https://securityaffairs.com/183183/malware/rondodox-botnet-targets-56-flaws-across-30-device-types-worldwide.html (2025-10-10T04:33:56Z)】.
- **Who/What is Affected:** The botnet targets a wide array of internet-facing consumer and enterprise edge devices, including routers, DVRs, NVRs, CCTV systems, and web servers 【https://www.securityweek.com/rondodox-botnet-takes-exploit-shotgun-approach/ (2025-10-10T12:06:03Z)】.
- **Why it Matters:** The botnet's strategy of using a large volume of exploits for N-day vulnerabilities maximizes its chances of compromising unpatched devices, creating a widespread threat to organizations' network perimeters.

**Assessment:**
- We assess with **High Confidence** that RondoDox poses a significant threat to organizations with poor patch management for internet-exposed devices. Its noisy, high-volume scanning approach increases the likelihood of opportunistic infections.
- The botnet's focus on a diverse range of IoT and network devices indicates its primary motive is likely building a large network for DDoS attacks or other malicious activities.

**Relevance:**
- Any organization with internet-facing network hardware, IoT devices, or servers is a potential target. This highlights the critical importance of a comprehensive asset inventory and vulnerability management program for perimeter devices.

**ATT&CK:**
- T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application
- T1203: Exploitation for Client Execution

**Detection Ideas:**
- Monitor firewall and IDS/IPS logs for a high volume of scanning and exploitation attempts against a wide range of ports and services originating from single IP addresses.
- Analyze network traffic from edge devices for unusual outbound connections, which could indicate a successful compromise and C2 communication.

**Mitigations:**
- Ensure all internet-facing devices are running the latest firmware and software patches.
- Disable or restrict access to unnecessary services and management interfaces on edge devices.
- Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of a compromised perimeter device.

#### Chinese Actor Storm-2603 Abuses DFIR Tool in Ransomware Attacks
- **What Happened:** The Chinese-nexus threat actor Storm-2603 is abusing Velociraptor, a legitimate open-source digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) tool, to gain persistent access and deploy malware in victim networks 【https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/chinese-hackers-velociraptor-ir-tool-ransomware-attacks (2025-10-10T15:53:51Z)】.
- **Why it Matters:** This is a classic example of "Living off the Land," where attackers use legitimate, trusted tools to evade detection. Abusing a DFIR tool is particularly insidious as its activity can be mistaken for legitimate security operations.

**Assessment:**
- We assess with **High Confidence** that this TTP complicates detection efforts. Security teams may overlook Velociraptor activity, assuming it is part of an authorized investigation.
- This tactic demonstrates the actor's sophistication and focus on stealth and persistence within compromised environments.

**Relevance:**
- This is relevant to any organization, particularly those that may already use Velociraptor or other DFIR tools. It requires security teams to be able to distinguish between benign and malicious use of administrative tools.

**ATT&CK:**
- T1078: Valid Accounts
- T1136: Create Account
- T1219: Remote Access Software

**Detection Ideas:**
- Monitor for unexpected or unauthorized deployments of Velociraptor agents.
- Baseline legitimate Velociraptor activity. Hunt for anomalies, such as agents being deployed from unusual sources, communicating with unknown servers, or executing suspicious commands.
- Sigma Rule Idea: `title: Suspicious Velociraptor Execution` -> `detection:` `process_creation:` `Image|contains: 'velociraptor'` `CommandLine|contains: 'config'` `and not CommandLine|contains: 'trusted_config_path'` `condition: process_creation`

**Mitigations:**
- Implement application control to restrict the execution of unauthorized software, including unapproved instances of legitimate tools.
- Enforce the principle of least privilege to prevent attackers from gaining the administrative rights needed to deploy tools like Velociraptor.

---

### 7. Third-Party & Supply Chain Notes

- **SonicWall:** The company has revised its initial assessment of a security incident, now confirming that attackers accessed firewall configuration backup files for **all** customers using the MySonicWall cloud backup feature. This is a significant escalation from the initial claim of "fewer than 5%" and poses a serious risk, as attackers may possess detailed network blueprints of affected organizations 【https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/sonicwall-investigation-hackers-access-customer-backup/802598/ (2025-10-10T14:56:03Z)】.
- **Gladinet / Triofox:** The active exploitation of a zero-day in this file-sharing software poses a direct supply chain risk to organizations that rely on it or have partners who do.

---

### 8. Detections & Response Playbook Updates

- **Playbook Update:** Enhance incident response playbooks for compromises involving legitimate administrative tools. Add steps to verify the integrity and authorization of any DFIR or remote access software (e.g., Velociraptor) found during an investigation.
- **Playbook Update:** Update ransomware playbooks to include specific checks for data exfiltration from enterprise applications like Oracle E-Business Suite, especially following alerts of zero-day exploitation.

---

### 9. Metrics & Hygiene

- **Patching:** Immediate action is required for publicly-facing systems running Gladinet, Oracle EBS, and vulnerable WordPress plugins. The emergence of the RondoDox botnet reinforces the need for consistent patching of all internet-facing edge devices.
- **End-of-Life:** Microsoft has issued a reminder that Home and Pro editions of Windows 11 23H2 will reach their end-of-support date in 30 days. All systems must be upgraded to a supported version to continue receiving security updates 【https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-11-23h2-home-and-pro-reach-end-of-support-in-30-days/ (2025-10-10T19:34:13Z)】.

---

### 10. Assumptions, Gaps, and Tasking

- **Assumption:** We assume that threat actors exploiting the vulnerabilities in Gladinet and Oracle EBS are financially motivated, aiming for data theft and extortion.
- **Gap:** There is a lack of specific, actionable IOCs (file hashes, C2 domains) for the new RondoDox, Stealit, and ClayRat malware campaigns in the available reporting. Detection will rely more heavily on behavioral analysis.
- **Tasking:**
    *   **Task IT/Vulnerability Management:** Initiate immediate scans to identify all instances of Gladinet, Oracle E-Business Suite, and the vulnerable Service Finder WordPress plugin. Prioritize patching based on findings.
    *   **Task IT Operations:** Provide an inventory and upgrade plan for all systems running Windows 11 23H2 before the end-of-support date.
    *   **Task SOC/Threat Hunting:** Proactively hunt for signs of malicious Velociraptor activity and directory traversal attacks against web applications.
