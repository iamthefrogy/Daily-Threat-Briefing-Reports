    *   The technique involves analyzing features of a process loading a DLL, such as the module's path, its signature status, and its relationship to the parent process, to identify anomalous behavior.
    *   The researchers successfully integrated this model into their SIEM platform, enabling them to uncover several real-world incidents in their early stages [【securelist.com, 2025-10-06T08:00:08Z】](https://securelist.com/detecting-dll-hijacking-with-machine-learning-in-kaspersky-siem/117567/).
- **Assessment:**
    *   We assess with **High Confidence** that DLL hijacking remains a prevalent and effective defense evasion technique used by a wide range of threat actors.
    *   We assess with **Medium Confidence** that while building a full ML model may be resource-intensive for most organizations, the logic and features described by the researchers can be adapted into heuristic-based detection rules for SIEM and EDR platforms.
- **Relevance:**
    *   This research provides a valuable framework for threat hunting and detection engineering. Understanding the indicators of DLL hijacking can help security teams create more robust defenses against a common attacker TTP used for persistence and privilege escalation.
- **ATT&CK:**
    *   T1574.001: Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Search Order Hijacking
    *   T1574.002: Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading
- **Detection Ideas:**
    *   **Sigma Rule (Pseudo-code):**
```yaml\n        title: Suspicious Unsigned DLL Loaded from Non-Standard Path\n        logsource:\n          product: windows\n          service: security\n          # Or EDR process/module load events\n        detection:\n          selection:\n            EventID: 4688 # Process Creation or EDR equivalent\n            ImageLoaded: '*.dll'\n            ImageLoaded|endswith:\n              - '\Temp\*'\n              - '\Users\*'\n              - '\Windows\Temp\*'\n            Signed: 'false'\n          filter:\n            # Add known good processes/DLLs here\n            ProcessName|contains: 'legit_app.exe'\n          condition: selection and not filter\n        ```
    *   Hunt for legitimate, signed processes loading unsigned DLLs from unusual locations (e.g., user profiles, temp directories).
    *   Monitor for processes that load a DLL with the same name as a legitimate system DLL but from a different file path.
- **Mitigations:**
    *   Utilize EDR solutions with capabilities to detect and block suspicious module loads.
    *   Application developers should specify the full path to DLLs when loading them to prevent search order hijacking.

### 10. Assumptions, Gaps, and Tasking

- **Assumption:** We assume that Cl0p's primary motivation in the Oracle EBS campaign is data theft for extortion, not destructive ransomware deployment, aligning with their recent strategic shift. (Confidence: High)
- **Gaps:** Specific IOCs (file hashes, C2 domains/IPs) for the active exploitation campaigns against Oracle EBS and Zimbra are not present in the available open-source reporting. These are likely contained within vendor-provided materials.
- **Tasking:**
    *   **Vulnerability Management:** Complete the emergency scans for Oracle EBS (CVE-2025-61882) and Zimbra (CVE-2025-27915) and report all vulnerable instances by 16:00 UTC.
    *   **Security Operations:** Ingest IOCs from the official Oracle security alert for CVE-2025-61882 into monitoring platforms as soon as they are available.
    *   **Threat Hunting:** Proactively hunt for signs of DLL hijacking using the detection logic provided in Section 8.
